# FamilyWeb
Genealogy program that will create a web page for each member, event, and family page.

It is not always good to use C++ to make a website, But in this case I believe it is very appropriate.
Using a program that you can compile on most any computer where you add your family tree. The program would be able to create your famly tree website, where each member has their own web page. 

Still under construction...
